# New-PoshBotFileUpload

## SYNOPSIS
Tells PoshBot to upload a file to the chat network.

## SYNTAX

### Path (Default)
```
New-PoshBotFileUpload [-Path] <String[]> [-Title <String>] [-DM] [-KeepFile] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### LiteralPath
```
New-PoshBotFileUpload [-LiteralPath] <String[]> [-Title <String>] [-DM] [-KeepFile] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Returns a custom object back to PoshBot telling it to upload the given file to the chat network.
The custom object
can also tell PoshBot to redirect the file upload to a DM channel with the calling user.
This could be useful if
the contents the bot command returns are sensitive and should not be visible to all users in the channel.
