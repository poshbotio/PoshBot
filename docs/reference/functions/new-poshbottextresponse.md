# New-PoshBotTextResponse

## SYNOPSIS
Tells PoshBot to handle the text response from a command in a special way.

## SYNTAX

```
New-PoshBotTextResponse [-Text] <String[]> [-AsCode] [-DM] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Responses from PoshBot commands can be sent back to the channel they were posted from (default) or redirected to a DM channel with the
calling user.
This could be useful if the contents the bot command returns are sensitive and should not be visible to all users
in the channel.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
function Get-Foo {
```

\[cmdletbinding()\]
    param(
        \[parameter(mandatory)\]
        \[string\]$MyParam
    )

    New-PoshBotTextResponse -Text $MyParam -DM
}

When Get-Foo is executed by PoshBot, the text response will be sent back to the calling user as a DM rather than back in the channel the
command was called from.
This could be useful if the contents the bot command returns are sensitive and should not be visible to all users
in the channel.
